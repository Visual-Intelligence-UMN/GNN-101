                    <p>
                        GNN Stands for Graph Neural Networks. As its name suggests, GNN is a
                        class of neural networks that operate on graph data, which is a
                        collection of nodes connected by edges. Consider social networks as
                        an example, GNNs can analyze connections to understand communities,
                        predict behavior, or recommend products based on social
                        interactions. Nowadays, GNNs are increasingly used to solve a wide
                        variety of tasks such as model molecules in chemistry, predict
                        protein interactions in biology, or studying citation networks in
                        social science.

                        To start, let`s establish what a graph is. A graph represents the
                        relations (edges) between a collection of entities (nodes). For
                        example, the right panel shows a graph of a chemical compound, from

                        atoms.

                        A graph can be represented as either a node-link diagram or an
                        adjacency matrix. A node-link diagram is an intuitive visual
                        representation of the graph where nodes are depicted as circles and
                        edges are lines connecting the circles. It is easy to understand and
                        informative, especially for small graphs.
                        <br />
                        An adjacency matrix is a square matrix where the rows and columns
                        represent the nodes, and the value at each intersection (cell)
                        indicates the presence or absence of an edge between the
                        corresponding nodes. It is a compact way to represent the graph,
                        especially for large and dense graphs.

                    <span className={styles.tag}>Node Features</span>
                    <p>
                        The information of each graph node can be stored as embeddings. For
                        example, in the chemical compound graph, an one-hot encoding is used
                        to represent the atom type, whether it is a carbon, oxygen,
                        nitrogen, etc.

                        Graphs have an irregular structure can directly use traditional neural networks, which are designed to operate on
                        a fixed, grid-like structure input (such as sentences, images and video).
                        To process graphs, GNNs employ a technique called <span className="font-bold">message passing</span>, where neighboring nodes exchange information and update
                        each other`&apos;`s embeddings  to better reflect their interconnectedness and individual features.

                    <p>
                        Message-passing forms the backbone of many GNN architectures,
                        including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention
                        Networks (GAT), Graph Sample and Aggregate (GraphSAGE), Graph
                        Isomorphism Network (GIN), etc.
                        The main differences between these GNN variants are the way they aggregate information from neighbors and the way they update node embeddings.

                    <p>We will start with GCN, which is one

                            <b className="font-bold"> W</b>. Intuitively, this reduces the influence of information from nodes with too many neighbors and strengthens the influence from those with fewer neighbors.

                        Note that the learnable weight matrix and bias vector are shared across all nodes in the graph, mimicking the convolution operation in CNNs and minimizing the number of parameters.

                            Given the learned features of each node, GNN can directly predict the node properties. For example, in the Karate dataset, the task is to

                            After sevela layers of GCNConv, we apply a <b className="font-bold">fully connected layer </b> to each node to make the prediction.

                            GNN can predict the properties of each edge
                            in the graph. For example, in the PPI dataset, the task is to
                            predict whether two proteins interact with each other. After several layers of GCNConv,
                            we combine the features of the two nodes of a given edge (e.g., by concatenation) and then apply a fully connected layer to make the prediction.
